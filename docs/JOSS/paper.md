# Summary
...
<!--

# Statement of need
The advent of a new generation of telescopes and instruments has led to a dramatic increase in the quality of observations of exoplanets and brown dwarfs [...]. For example, spectroscopic observations with JWST cover fainter objects over a wide wavelength-range (1-20 um) which was previously inaccessible by ground- or space-based facilities [...]. Similarly, developments in direct-imaging instrumentation allow astronomers to measure the spectral emission of exoplanet companions at closer separations to their host stars [...]. Significant progress has also been made in the ability to model these spectra with various software used for radiative transfer, chemistry, cloud-condensation, etc. Recently, these tools are coupled with sampling algorithms to infer properties about the atmospheres of the studied objects [...]. 

<!-- 
With the advent of new telescopes/instruments (JWST, ELT/METIS, VLT/CRIRES, Keck/KPIC), the quality of observations has dramatically increased. 
In addition, new retrieval techniques have made it possible to infer atmospheric properties, including atmospheric abundances. 

With high signal-to-noises and high resolution spectra, it becomes increasingly clear that model deficiencies, not the data-quality, limits our ability to evaluate the atmospheric conditions. 
An important aspect of these spectral models is the accuracy of the line list, and the pressure and/or temperature on which the opacity cross-sections are calculated.
